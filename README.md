# Card-Fans

A simple HTML page (with some JavaScript) to display card fans using CSS. Although my job has required both back-end and front-end work for most of my career, I do not get to work a lot on CSS (certainly not animation). This is a scratchpad for me to learn transformations.

To keep it as simple as possible, no LESS, SASS, libraries, etc have been used.
